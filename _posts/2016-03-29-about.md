Who am I?

Growing up, I loved to read and write. Searching for my mission in life, I started down the long road of self-development. This is where I realised that my interests could indeed be my vocation.

I love studying health, ancient wisdom, metaphysics, natural phenomena, quantum theory, and spirituality. Through personal experimentation, I'm able to share unique insights about the journey to well-being and an ideal lifestyle.

The three guiding principles of my life now are simplicity, sustainability, and soul. I choose to live consciously, travel the world, and inspire by example.

I am a truth seeker.

How do I know when I find it? The only way anyone can know what's true: truth resonates with your entire being.

What do I do with it? Share it of course!

Why? I believe in freedom, happiness and peace for all -- and the truth shall set you free.
